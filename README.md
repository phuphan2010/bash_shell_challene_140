Solution for Create twenty-five file name with bash shell script

Write a bash script to:

Create twenty-five empty (0 KB) files (Hint: Use the touch command).
The file names should be <yourName><number>, <yourName><number+1>, <yourName><number+2> and so on.
Design the script so that each time you execute it, it creates the next batch of 25 files with increasing numbers starting with the last or max number that already exists.
Do not hard code these numbers. You need to generate them using automation.
Test the script. Display a long list of the directory and its contents to validate that the script created the expected files.

Save the script and make a note of its location (absolute path) for future reference.
